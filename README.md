# cs430-proj1-images

Converts files between PPM P3 and PPM P6 formats. Other PPM formats are not supported.

## Usage
```
ppmrw target_format input_filename output_filename
```
* target_format: 3 or 6, the type of PPM file to output
* input_filename: the filename of the file to convert (the program autodetects the PPM format of the input file)
* output_filename: the filename of the file to create


### Example
Converts my_image.ppm to the PPM P3 format and saves it to my_image_ppm3.ppm
```
ppmrw 3 my_image.ppm my_image_ppm3.ppm
```
